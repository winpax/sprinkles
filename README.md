**Please note this library is currently in an early stage of development, and is not recommended for use in production.
There are likely to be breaking changes in the future, and there is no guarantee that the API will remain stable until v1.0.**

Sprinkles is a library for interacting with [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), the Windows package manager.

It provides a high-level API for interacting with [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), such as installing, updating, and removing packages.

## Example Usage

If you want a more in depth example of how to use the library, check out the [sfsu](https://github.com/winpax/sfsu) project.

```rust
use sprinkles::contexts::{User, ScoopContext};

let ctx = User::new();

let apps = ctx.installed_apps().unwrap();

println!("You have {} apps installed", apps.len());
```

## Running Benchmarks

The benchmarks rely on the `large-file.bin` file, which should be a large amount (>100MB) of random data.

To generate the file, run the following command (feel free to change the size to your liking):

### Windows

Install [genfile](https://github.com/winpax/genfile) and run the following command:

```powershell
genfile --size 512M -o benches/large-file.bin --random
```

### Linux

```bash
dd if=/dev/urandom of=benches/large-file.bin bs=1M count=512
```

## Supported Platforms

I will maintain support for the MSRV mentioned in Cargo.toml, although it may change across a major version.

Windows is the only supported platform at the moment, and this will likely not change, given that Scoop is only available on Windows.
